        <h3>The Age of Innocence</h3>
        <h3>-By Edith Wharton</h3>

        <h4>THE PLOT:</h4>
        <p>Newland Archer, gentleman lawyer and heir of one of New York City's most illustrious families, happily anticipates his highly desirable marriage 
            to the sheltered and beautiful May Welland. But he finds reason to doubt his choice of bride after the appearance of Countess Ellen Olenska, May's
            exotic and beautiful cousin. Ellen strikes Archer as the opposite of the innocent and ignorant May. She has returned to New York from Europe 
            after scandalously separating herself (per rumor) from a disastrous marriage to a Polish count. At first, Ellen's arrival and its potential 
            effect on the reputation of his bride-to-be's family disturbs Newland, but he becomes intrigued by Ellen, who brazenly flouts New York society's
            fastidious rules. As Newland's admiration for her grows, so do his doubts about marrying May, a perfect product of Old New York society; the
            match no longer seems the ideal fate he had imagined.</p>
            <p>Back in New York and under renewed pressure from Newland, Ellen relents and agrees to meet with him in secret to consummate their 
                relationship. But shortly after their conversation, Newland discovers that Ellen has decided to return to Europe. When May announces that 
                she and Newland are throwing a farewell party for Ellen, Newland makes up his mind to abandon May and follow Ellen to Europe. That night,
                 after the party, Newland resolves to tell May he is leaving her for Ellen. She interrupts him to tell him that she learned that morning 
                 that she is pregnant; she reveals that she had told Ellen of her pregnancy two weeks earlier, despite not being sure of it at the time. 
                 The implication is that May did so because she suspected the affair and that this is Ellen's reason for returning to Europe. Hopelessly 
                 trapped, Newland decides to remain with May and not to follow Ellen, surrendering his love for his child's sake.</p>
