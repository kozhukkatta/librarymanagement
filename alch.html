        <h3>The Alchemist</h3>
        <h3>-By Paulo Coelho</h3>
        <img src="img/alch.jpg" alt="">
        <h4>THE PLOT:</h4>
        <p>An Andalusian shepherd boy named Santiago dreams of a treasure while in a ruined church. He consults a Gypsy fortune-teller about the meaning
        of the recurring dream. The woman interprets it as a prophecy, telling the boy that he will discover a treasure at the Egyptian pyramids.</p>

        <p>After Santiago sets out he meets an old king, Melchizedek, or the king of Salem, who tells him to sell his sheep so as to travel to Egypt 
        and accomplish his "Personal Legend". Early on his arrival in Africa, a man who claims to be able to take Santiago to the pyramids instead
        robs him of the money he had made from his flock. Santiago then has to work for a crystal merchant to earn enough to get to the pyramids.</p>

        <p>Along the way, the boy meets an Englishman who has come in search of an alchemist and continues his travels with his new companion. When they reach 
        an oasis, Santiago meets and falls in love with an Arabian girl named Fatima, to whom he proposes marriage. She promises to marry him only after he 
        completes his journey. Frustrated at first, he later learns that true love will not stop nor must one sacrifice one's destiny to it, since to do so 
        robs it of truth.</p>

        <p>The boy then encounters a wise alchemist, who teaches him to realize his true self. Together, they risk a journey through the territory of 
        warring tribes, where Santiago is forced to demonstrate his oneness with the "Soul of the World" by turning himself into a dust storm before 
        he is allowed to proceed.</p>
